# GeoGhana: Geospatial Tools for Ghana's Districts

GeoGhana is an open-source Python library designed to simplify working with geospatial data of Ghana's districts, including their latest geomap updates. It aims to provide engineers, researchers, and developers with easy-to-use tools for reading, manipulating, and visualizing geospatial data specific to Ghana's administrative boundaries.

## Features In Development

- **Read and Write Geospatial Data**: Supports Shapefile (.shp, .dbf, .shx) and TopoJSON (.json) formats.
- **Spatial Operations**: Perform intersect, union, buffer, and merge operations effortlessly.
- **CRS Management**: Convert and manage different Coordinate Reference Systems.
- **Data Visualization**: Plot and visualize geospatial data with ease.
- **Data Manipulation**: Efficiently filter, sort, and manipulate geospatial datasets.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimized for handling large geospatial datasets.
- **Python Data Stack Integration**: Works seamlessly with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and more.
- **Utility Functions**: Includes utilities for area, distance, and perimeter calculations.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Well-documented code with examples to get you started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. GeoGhana depends on GeoPandas, Fiona, and other geospatial libraries, which will be installed during the installation process.

### Installation

Install GeoGhana using pip:

```bash
pip install geoghana
```

### Quick Example

```python
from geoghana import load_shapefile, plot_districts

# Load Ghana's districts shapefile
gdf = load_shapefile("path/to/District_271.shp")

# Plot the districts
plot_districts(gdf)
```
